# 🌱 Focus Garden

**Focus Garden** is a unique interactive web experience built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The project encourages **calm and focus** by rewarding the user with a **hidden bloom animation** after 30 seconds of inactivity.

Instead of scores or instructions, this project explores **behavior-driven interaction**.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Make sure you have these three files together:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `script.js`
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.
4. Do **nothing** for 30 seconds and watch the garden bloom.
5. Interacting (click, scroll, move mouse, press key) resets the timer.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- **Calm Timer**: A JavaScript timer checks for 30 seconds of inactivity.
- **Hidden Bloom**: After 30 seconds of calm, a CSS animation triggers the bloom and floating fireflies.
- **Reset on Interaction**: Any user interaction resets the timer, hiding the bloom until calm is restored.
- **UX Concept**: This demonstrates **delight through discovery**—the reward is hidden, encouraging focus instead of constant interaction.

- No instructions, no scoring → the interaction itself is the game.  
- Encourages mindfulness and rewards patience.  
- Shows understanding of **UX, human behavior, and subtle animation design**.
